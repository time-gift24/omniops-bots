/*
 * Storyboard
 * 1. Teaser: 0.6s after mount the card blur-rises into its corner, then the
 *    release thumbnails fan out behind each other 70ms apart. Hovering the
 *    card spreads the fan a little. Dismissing drops it 16px and fades in
 *    180ms.
 * 2. Spotlight: AnimatedModal scales the panel in. The active slide's image
 *    drifts slowly (Ken Burns) while it is on screen.
 * 3. Changing slides: media slides and un-blurs in from the side of travel
 *    while the old slide leaves the other way; the copy follows 80ms later.
 *    The active step dot stretches into a pill with a layout spring.
 * 4. Dragging the media follows the finger with resistance (rubber-band at
 *    the first and last slide) and springs back on release.
 * Reduced motion: no transforms, blur, or Ken Burns. The teaser and slides
 * cross-fade, and dragging does not move the media.
